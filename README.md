Welcome to my Personal Projects Page!
Don't expect anything interesting here, it will just be simple projects I work on for fun and some other stuff.
Everything is divided into 3 Categories: 
For Fun: Projects I work on if I'm bored or whatever, nothing really interesting
Requested: Any Projects that I was challenged to do or requested to do will be here
School: Wanna unblock Games? Wanna hide games from your teachers? Look no further! This is most likely the only interesting category, it contain stuff like about blank embedders. In the future all of these will be on a single website for ease of use.
